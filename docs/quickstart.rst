Quickstart
**********

After having completed the :doc:`installation <installation>`, you can follow this guide
to set up a minimal Flores site.


Generating your first site
==========================

In order to generate the minimal, basic template, you can simply run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ flores init

This will generate a basic site at the current directory. You can also specify any
directory you want:

.. code-block:: console

   $ flores init path/to/my/directory/

You'll see that the generated file & directory structure looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    .
    ├── _data
    │   └── config.json
    ├── _pages
    │   └── index.md
    └── _templates
        └── main.html


We have three directories of what is called the *site resources*. These are all the
directories and files that allow us to build the final static site.

In order to make sure the site works, we can run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ flores serve path/to/my/directory/

And then, if we navigate to the address given in the command line
(``http://localhost:4000`` by default), we should indeed have a running site:

.. image:: images/default_site.png

Now that we've verified that the site is running, let's go over the resources that make
building the site possible.


What are templates?
-------------------

Under the ``_templates`` directory, we have the `Jinja templates 
<https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/>`_ themselves, which are
essentially enriched HTML files that allow the injection of data in them.

The templates are supposed to be basic, generic HTML documents in which page content
will be embedded. They are meant to be reusable and detached from the actual page
content.

Note that a template does not represent a final *page* on the site; a template may be
used to generate 0, 1 or multiple pages. The name you give a template will not appear
on the final site, but it will be used to identify the template when building the site.

Here is a basic template:

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title> {{ site.config.title }} </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {{ page.content }}
    </body>
    </html>


As you can probably tell, attributes of the site, of the page or other stuff (such as
control structures) are accessed through ``{{ }}`` blocks.

.. note::

   We strongly advise looking through the `Jinja templates documentation
   <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/>`_ to better understand how
   the template syntax works.


What are pages?
---------------

These are the actual pages that will appear on the site; there is a 1-to-1
correspondance between ``.md`` page files in the ``_pages`` directory and the final
``.html`` pages on the generated site. Here, for example, ``index.md`` will be used to
create an ``index.html`` page.

This is where pages and :ref:`templates <What are templates?>` come together: a page
file simply defines a template to use and then some content to put on the page.
Optionally, the user can also define other metadata to be used on the page (such as a
header image).

The syntax of the page files is essentially based on `Jekyll's Front Matter
<https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/>`_. The files are split into two parts:

    1. The frontmatter part (YAML, always comes first, always enclosed in triple dashes)
    2. The content part (Markdown)


Essentially, the file looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

   ---
   frontmatter goes here (YAML)
   ---
   content goes here (Markdown)


So, a minimal page file would look like:

.. code-block:: text

   ---
   template: main
   ---

   Hello, world!


Assuming a ``_templates/main.html`` file, this would create a page using that template,
and the page content would be ``<p>Hello, world!</p>``.


What are data files?
--------------------

In order to centralize some information that might get reused in various places in the
site, we can define custom data files that will then become accessible throughout the
pages and templates.

Data files are written in JSON and they are placed in the ``_data`` directory. Their
name determines the handle that is used to access their data in the site, but otherwise
has no importance. The only "special" name is ``config.json``, which is reserved to the
file containing special configuration parameters for the site. Another key difference
is that, while for a file named ``foo.json`` the data will be accessed through the
handle ``site.data.foo``, for ``config.json`` it will be accessed through
``site.config``.

When talking about :ref:`templates <What are templates?>` before, we saw this snippet
of code:

.. code-block:: html

   <title> {{ site.config.title }} </title>


This means that we can define the site's title in ``_data/config.json``:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "title": "My awesome site"
   }


And it will then be injected through that handle, as if we had written:

.. code-block:: html

   <title> My awesome site </title>


.. warning::

   Be careful when accessing site data that might not exist; for ``site.data.foo.bar``
   to be valid, a ``_data/foo.json`` file must exist, and it must contain a ``bar`` key.
